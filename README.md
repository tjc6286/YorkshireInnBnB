# Team Infinity: Senior Development Project

**Project Name** : Yorkshire Innâ€™s booking system upgrade

**Project Objective:** 

Our objectives for this project are to create a new design for the website, starting with a complete restructure of the frontend of the system. We must also research and build up a new hosting platform for the website, one that better suits the needs of the owners. A complete redesign of the backend, making sure to satisfy the MVP requirements, that of which is not allowing double bookings to occur within the booking system. We must create an admin portal for the owners, allowing them to make changes to room pricing and view reporting of past reservation data, trends, etc. This would include a need for a new database for storage of customer and reservation information when bookings are made.

## Third-Party API

This API endpoint allows vendors to create a booking for their customers. The request must include a valid vendorKey and the booking details. At the moment there is no current process to request for an admin to generate a vendor key.

### Endpoint 

The endpoint for this API is:

```bash
POST www.yorkshireinnteaminfinity.com/api/vendor/createBooking
```

### Request Payload

The request payload must be in JSON format and should include the following parameters:

- `vendorKey` (string, required): the vendor key for authentication purposes.
- `itinerary` (array, required): an array of objects representing the itinerary for the booking. Each object should include the following parameters:
  - `roomName` (string, required): the name of the room being booked.

    - `bookingFee` (integer, required): the booking fee for the room.

- `amount` (integer, required): the amount paid for the booking.
- `datesOfStay` (array, required): an array of dates representing the dates of stay for the booking. Each date should be in the format "MM/DD/YYYY".
